# ISO 27001 Foundations Course

## Overview

As I have a keen interest in GRC, I decided I would start with the bread and butter in Info Sec — ISO 27001. What initially peaked my interest into the topic was when I heard that my current company was undergoing the process to become compliant in order to show our clients that we take security seriously.

Given ISO 27001 is considered a "company" certification — I wanted to learn how I could begin to understand the fundamentals of the framework and how it operates as a whole, as well as understand how I can create and implement an ISMS effectively within an organisation. Since, there are no official ways of becoming ISO 27001 certified as an individual, this is when I came across the ISO 27001 Foundations Course by Dejan Kosutic. 

## Course Structure

The course is split up into six different modules. Introduction to ISO 27001, the Planning phase, Risk Management phase, the Do phase, the Check and Act phases, and lastly, a general overview of the different Annex A controls. At the end of each of the phases, there were shorts quizzes to help ensure that the reader understood the content that we had just learnt.

## Key Takeaways

For me, the biggest takeaway that I took from this foundations course was how easily I could rabbit hole into asking myself deeper security and compliance questions. Learning this content really challenged my critical thinking and pushed me to analyse all these assets and controls from multiple angles. Everytime something was said about change control or management of vulnerabilities, it encouraged me to explore how I can apply some of these principles in practice. 

For example, in my current role, Patching is one of my niche's. It's something I take very seriously, as I overlook just over 1,050 servers per month and ensure that they are patched accordingly in a timely manner. One of Annex A's controls in an ISMS is the <b>Management of Technical Vulnerabilities</b>, which involves identifying, assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities. As I began to understand this more, I quickly started asking questions like:

- What Patch Management system does an organisation use, and how is it structured?
- How often are patch scans performed to identify missing patches for endpoints?
- Is patching automated? If so, how is it controlled?
- What's the process for patching critical CVE's, and how quickly are these addressed?
- Who owns CVE patching, and how is accountability managed within x team?

I suddenly realised how overwhelming some of this analysis can be, but also understand how critical it is for an organisation to address these questions effectively in order to ensure that ISMS requirements are met. This is just one of many examples of analysis I have for controls that I learned undertaking the course. However, but doing all this analysis enabled me to shift my approach from a more technical implentation of controls to a more structured process of defining and managing risk. 

## Creating my own Security Audit

Now that I have completed this course, I wanted to apply some of the things I learned during the course to a "real world example" of a company and complete a risk assessment.
